# Neural_Machine_Translation

`Seq2SeqTranslation` is the simple neural machine translation model(using Encoder-Decoder Network) that will translate English sentences to Spanish.
In short,the English sentences are fed to the encoder,and the decoder outputs the Spanish Translation.Note that the Spanish Translation are also used as inputs to the decoder during training for teacher forcing.
